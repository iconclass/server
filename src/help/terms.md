# Terms

This used to be some place-holder text, but it was confusing to new users. We need to invest some time into writing up these terms.

In a nutshell, the intentions are to:

- respect user privacy

- not to install ANY third-party trackers or cookies

- comply with any requests from copyright holders to remove infringing materials

- foster a respectful, helpful community of ICONCLASS users

If anyone in the community feels inspired to organise a brain-storming session to help us improve this documentation, [please get in touch](https://forms.gle/twPq7swQZXmSX46G8)
