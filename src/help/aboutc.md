### C. Web-based pictorial information systems using Iconclass for subject access

Here are listed the databases that are available online. Some of them, e.g. [British Book Illlustrations](#folger) and the [Virtuelles Kupferstichkabinett](#vkk), are using the Harvester of Iconclass Metadata (HIM) technology, which allows them to offer most of the search functionalities of the Iconclass Browser. If you have additional information about websites offering Iconclass search capabilities, please let us know.
