#### Preparing to use

The purpose of the Iconclass Browser is to help you find your way to the ready-made concepts with which you can create subject access to your collection of images. For inspiration and comparison thousands of indexed images have been added to the Browser. To make use of this new functionality, please register and login. It is free and easy. As we aim to put additional features at the disposal of registered users - e.g. tagging your own images - it makes even more sense to create a personal account.
