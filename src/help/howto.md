## How to use the Illustrated Iconclass

{{% aimg howtostart %}}

This page focusses on the practical functionalities of the Illustrated Iconclass Browser. It summarizes the explanation of Iconclass and systematic iconography you will find in [our more extensive contextualization](/help/search){:target="\_read"}. Since the illustrated browser is still work in progress, you may see some minor discrepancies between the screenshots below and the actual screens of the browser. Should this lead to questions, do let us know via the Feedback button (top right).

#### Register and login to use

The purpose of the Iconclass Browser is to help you find your way to the ready-made concepts with which you can create subject access to your collection of images. For inspiration and comparison thousands of indexed images have been added to the Browser. To make use of this new functionality, please **register and login**. It is free and easy. As we aim to put additional features at the disposal of registered users - e.g. tagging your own images - it makes even more sense to create a personal account.

#### Login, Feedback and Main Categories

Once registered and logged in to the system you will see your email address as **user name** appear next to the Feedback button in the top right corner of the browser window. Clicking the Feedback button will open a Google Form where you can enter your questions or comments.
At the left you will see the 10 main categories of the Iconclass system, the starting position of the tree of concepts.

#### Basics of browsing

An alphanumeric code assigns each concept its unique place in the schedules. Concepts can be found in two ways: either **Browse** the tree from the top down or **Search** the database with the help of keywords.
The tree of concepts is organized hierarchically. Click a concept to select it and see its subdivisions. You can open multiple branches of the tree simultaneously by clicking more than one concept, but the one you clicked on _last_ - i.e. the concept that has "_focus_" - is shown on the right.
As long as a concept has further subdivisions ("_children_") a black triangle is shown to its left. If not, i.e. if a concept is the _end node_ of a branch, it is preceded by a small dot.
If there are images in the database that were tagged with the selected concept, they will be shown as "**sample images**". If a concept was used to tag a large number of images, a random selection of sample images is shown.

#### Basics of searching

By default searches start with words. Those words can be part of concept definitions or part of the _entry vocabulary_, i.e. the hand-picked keywords assigned to most concepts. You can use multiple (key)words - like **old** and **man** - in a single search.
The results for a keyword search are sorted either by **relevance** or by [**notation**](basics#notation){:target="\_read"}. Clicking on a concept in the list of results has the same effect as clicking on a concept in the tree: the selected concept is shown on the right.

The context of the concept that has _focus_ is also shown on the right. The _path_ of broader terms is included, up to the main category. The cumulative keywords are offered for searches. The narrower terms or _children_ are listed below the keywords

#### Explore the context

Whether the concept tree or the list of search results is shown on the left, clicking a concept has the same effect: the selected concept appears on the right in its own specific context.
Clicking a concept on the right _after a keyword search_, however, causes the **Browse** and **Search** tab on the left to switch places. The concept tree is always moved to the front. However, the list of search results is kept in the background, so you can switch views by simply clicking the tabs.
Do note that you can select terms from the (_path_) or the (_children_) to see them in the concept tree. The screenshot shows one of the children of **31D16** in the concept tree.
