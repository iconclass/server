# About

The Iconclass system has a long history that started in the 1940â€™s. The classification itself went through several phases, both as a printed publication and in its digital format since the early 1990's. The system was frequently reviewed and discussed, and there is a range of publications containing iconographic indices based on the Iconclass schedules. Over the years the digital version has been the subject of quite a few conference lectures, and it has been transformed into a retrieval module for a variety of websites.

Together these publicatinos and emanations offer valuable insights in the ideas of Van de Waal and the evolution of the subject access to images - both visual and textual.

On these documentation pages we shall attempt to bring together as many primary sources as possible, most of them published, but some of them so far unpublished. We have begun to draft a bibliography of publication of and about Iconclass and gathered the conference presentations we have delivered in the past decades.
