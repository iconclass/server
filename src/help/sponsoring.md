## Towards a sustainable Iconclass system

Iconclass is used by a steadily growing number of institutions and projects, to provide subject access to image collections. That is a development we obviously welcome.

At the same time it is cause for concern; for the simple reason that this also means that an increasing number of professional and institutional users - a selection of which you see below - has come to depend on what is essentially a volunteer service.

For some twenty years now we have managed to make the Iconclass system available in the shape of the online _Iconclass browser_ and the _Harvester of Iconclass Metadata_ service.
While we remain committed to creating a stable situation for Iconclass, and ensuring the continued availability of an online Iconclass system in __Open Access__, it is clear that in the long run this cannot depend on the commitment of two individuals. The active involvement of the community of Iconclass users is a necessary condition for a stable future.

### Henri van de Waal Foundation

To organize and structure the involvement is one of the goals of the <a href="https://henrivandewaalfoundation.org" target="read">Henri van de Waal Foundation</a>, founded in June of 2021. This non-profit Foundation aims to stimulate computer-assisted iconographic research in the widest possible sense, but also sees a first task in mobilizing the user community of Iconclass and setting up broader support for the maintenance and development of the system.
The Henri van de Waal Foundation is the legal entity that has assumed responsibility for the maintenance and further development of the Iconclass system with the formal endorsement of [the Netherlands Institute of Art History](https://henrivandewaalfoundation.org/Iconclasstransferstatement20211104.pdf){:target="read"}. The Foundation commits itself to continue publishing Iconclass as an _Open Access_ classification system. This commitment implies that the Foundation accepts that the system will remain a cost item, as _Open Access_ publications by definition do not produce any turnover.

### Consortium for the Support of Iconclass

Two conditions must be met for a more stable basis for Iconclass: some form of financing needs to be organized to help the Foundation carry the costs of maintenance and development. Perhaps even more importantly, however, a larger group of people should have detailed knowledge about editing the system and programming the software that runs it. Open data and open source software are a necessary, but not a sufficient condition...
To provide a platform and a structure for that support, the Foundation will set up a __Consortium for the Support of Iconclass__.
Before a Consortium can start fundraising initiatives or provide more systematic documentation about the editorial rules and the source code of the Browser system, several questions need to be answered.

- Who are the institutional and the individual users of the system, and how large is the actual and the potential Iconclass community?
- What effort is required to sustain the Iconclass Browser, technically and editorially?
- How much of the effort is structural, and how much is incidental?
- What are the estimated structural and incidental costs, divided over software development, editorial maintenance, server hardware and bandwidth?
- What will the Consortium membership entail?
- What are the plans for (software) products to support the wider acceptance of the Iconclass classification?


##### The user community
The Iconclass Browser has always been available to unregistered users, so we shall first have to build an administration of the user base before we can estimate its size and composition. The new version uses a system of registration because certain features, such as personalized clipboard functionalities, require the identification of individual users. Privacy rules obviously dictate that we shall have to ask the explicit permission of those who now register, to be approached about supporting the Consortium or contributing to the editorial or programming tasks.
For the same reason we shall also ask registered users whether they are prepared to publicly share information about the collection they are describing with Iconclass. It can help prevent unnecessary duplication of efforts if we can have some form of centralized administration of iconographic projects, but, more positively, it can be extremely useful to share insights and experiences with colleagues in similar projects.

##### Estimated effort
The amount of work that goes into editing the contents of Iconclass, and writing the software to run the system, can be extrapolated from our own experiences of the past two decades. As "no funding" also means "no bureaucracy", and as the workload fluctuates, the estimate does have a margin of error.

Maintaining the contents of the system can be subdivided into structural and incidental. "Structural" in this case means the correction of small errors and the occasional additions of better keywords or new concepts. "Incidental" work would be the addition of substantial groups of new concepts (as in __Alchemy__ or __Costume__) or the revision of outdated terminology, as in __Peoples and nationalities__. A major editorial effort can also be requierd to accommodate new translations of the whole system. A very rough
