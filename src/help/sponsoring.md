## Towards a sustainable Iconclass system

Iconclass is used by a steadily growing number of institutions and projects, to provide subject access to image collections. That is a development to be very pleased about.

At the same time it is cause for concern; for the simple reason that this also means that an increasing number of professional and institutional users - a selection of which you see below - has come to depend on what essentially is a volunteer service.

For some twenty years now we have managed to make the Iconclass system available in the shape of the online _Iconclass browser_ and the _Harvester of Iconclass Metadata_ service.
While we remain committed to creating a stable situation for Iconclass, and ensuring the continued availability of an online Iconclass system in __Open Access__, it is clear that this cannot depend on the commitment of a few individuals. The active involvement of the community of Iconclass users is a necessary condition for a stable future.

### Henri van de Waal Foundation

To organize and structure the involvement is one of the goals of the <a href="https://henrivandewaalfoundation.org" target="read">Henri van de Waal Foundation</a>, founded in June of 2021. This non-profit Foundation aims to stimulate computer-assisted iconographic research in the widest possible sense, but also sees a first task in mobilizing the user community of Iconclass and setting up broader support for the maintenance and development of the system.
The Henri van de Waal Foundation is the legal entity that has assumed responsibility for the maintenance and further development of the Iconclass system with the formal endorsement of [the Netherlands Institute of Art History](https://henrivandewaalfoundation.org/Iconclasstransferstatement20211104.pdf){:target="read"}. The Foundation commits itself to continue publishing Iconclass as an _Open Access_ classification system. This commitment implies that the Foundation accepts that the system will remain a cost item, as _Open Access_ publications by definition do not produce any turnover.

### Consortium for the Support of Iconclass

Two conditions will have to be met to provide a more stable basis for Iconclass: some form of financing needs to be found to meet the costs of maintenance and development, as those costs cannot be carried by the Foundation without the support of the user community. But, perhaps even more important, 


To provide a platform and a structure for that support, the Foundation will set up a __Consortium for the Support of Iconclass__.
Before such a Consortium can undertake any activity, let alone develop any fundraising initiatives, several questions need to be answered.
- Who are the institutional and the individual users of the system, and how large is the actual and the potential Iconclass community?
- What are the estimated structural and incidental costs, divided over software development, editorial maintenance, server hardware and bandwidth?
- What will the Consortium membership entail?
- What are the plans for (software) products to support the wider acceptance of the Iconclass classification?

The Iconclass Browser has always been available to unregistered users, so information about its user base is diffuse.
