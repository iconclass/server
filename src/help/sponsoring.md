### Towards a sustainable future for Iconclass
Over the years the Iconclass system has been used by many institutions to provide subject access to their collections, and for more than fifteen years we have managed to make the system available online for free, without significant sponsoring.
For one thing, this means - _incredibile dictu_ - that we have been carrying the costs of a server, bandwidth, domain name, etcetera, out or our own pockets.

We are obviously committed to creating a safe and stable situation, and to guarantee the continued availability over time of an online __Iconclass system in Open Access__. But it will be clear that this cannot completely depend on the commitment - and the financial situation - of two individuals.
Hence the non-profit <a href="https://henrivandewaalfoundation.org" target="read">Henri van de Waal Foundation</a> has been established. The foundation aims to stimulate computer-assisted iconographic research in the widest possible sense, but also to provide sustainable support for the maintenance and further development of Iconclass.

__Towards sponsoring__
Publishing anything in Open Access is always a precarious balancing act, and in few domains this is more true than in the Humanities. That is why the launch of this new version of the Iconclass site coincides with an initiative to recruit sponsors.
The Henri van de Waal Foundation aims to carry the cost of the Illustrated Iconclass Browser and its maintenance and development.
However, it cannot do so by itself and without support from the community of users of Iconclass.

__Iconclass consortium for the community of users__
The Henri van de Waal Foundation is the legal entity that will take over the cost of the online Iconclass system. The foundation aims to organize the support from the community of Iconclass users via a consortium. The consortium will act as a flexible, lightweight organization that will ask its members to contribute - in cash or in kind - to the common goal of an Open Access Iconclass website. As a legal entity the foundation will be the logical recipient of the contributions of sponsors in cash.

__Keeping it simple__
We are fully aware that this may sound somewhat simplistic and a little less than "professional". If so, that is precisely what we aim for, certainly in these initial stages: an __Illustrated Iconclass__ that is technically up-to-date and offers the functionality desired by its users, made sustainable by a small organization without any overhead.

In the Netherlands a consortium is understood to be a temporary organization of partners working towards a common goal. There is no default legal structure, so members have no default responsibilities or liabilities beyond what they have agreed to as partners.
