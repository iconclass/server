Due to the critical [log4shell vulnerability](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/the-log4shell-zeroday-4-days-on-what-is-it-and-how-bad-is-it-really/) we decided to move the switch-over from the old site to the newer version ahead, effective immediately.

While the new site is not completely done yet, we feel that it is more worthwhile investing effort into getting the last minor issues sorted to bring the new site on par with the old.
