Small bugfixes done to prepare for switching off old site.

A few weeks ago a "Help/How to use" file was started; also addressing more general issues of iconography. It is not yet linked, but it is [accessible as it progresses](/help/search)

For the previous six days, since adding the keywords to the search index, some results for certain search queries were not correct. Sorry about that, was due to human error. It has been fixed now, and as a bonus, we are also adding search for more languages. The index now includes English, German, French and Italian.

Received feedback from staff at Marburg and the Rijksmuseum that there are some critical aspects of the new server that does not support their work. As the system is used by professional catalogers on a daily basis, we are restoring the old system until the new system satisfies more criteria.

Added [notes on what is being done on the development of the new system](/help/dev).

Do you use the "old" system and have identified things in the new system which need attention? [Please let us know!](https://forms.gle/twPq7swQZXmSX46G8)

Due to the critical [log4shell vulnerability](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/the-log4shell-zeroday-4-days-on-what-is-it-and-how-bad-is-it-really/) we decided to move the switch-over from the old site to the newer version ahead, effective immediately.

While the new site is not completely done yet, we feel that it is more worthwhile investing effort into getting the last minor issues sorted to bring the new site on par with the old.
