# Translations

Originally, Iconclass was devised and published in English, even though it was invented by a Dutch-speaking person.

The system has been translated fully into:
[Deutsch](/de/_), [Fran√ßais](/fr/_), [Italiano](/it/_), [Portuguese](/pt/_) and [Japanese](/jp/_).

Partial translations to [Dutch](/nl/_), [Finnish](/fi/_) and [Chinese](/zh/_) have also been started.
