### Saints and Blessed - Sancti et Beati

The difference between those that have been __canonized__ (saints) and those that have been __beatified__ (blessed) is not primarily a difference of iconography. Images of saints and blessed are usually so similar that in Iconclass there was no instrument to systematically distinguish the two.
Yet, there is a difference - in theology and canon law. Even Wikipedia offers [a listing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_beatified_people) of beatified people.

Recently it was suggested by professor [Thomas Stäcker](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1509-6960) (University Library, university of Darmstadt) that Iconclass should somehow support the distinction.

Now, while it would not be too difficult, editorially, to add the concept to the schedules, simply splitting the concept "saints" in a section for "canonized" and a section for "beatified" would have serious consequences for existing database. The [Bildindex](https://www.bildindex.de/), for example, contains more than 100,000 images of male and female "saints", some of which may not actually have been canonized (yet).

By splitting the concept in two sections, we would - at least theoretically - force the editors of existing databases to check the existing descriptions. In many cases it would require a serious research effort to establish the exact status of the represented "saint". In some cases images would even be found of the same person having been beatified but not yet canonized, especially those who passed away in more recent times. One example may suffice to illustrate this dilemma: the Dutch Carmelite friar [Titus Brandsma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Brandsma) was beatified in 1985, and canonized in 2022. He was murdered in Dachau in 1942. All photographs of Brandsma obviously predate both his beatification and his canonization.

The following expansion of the system might allow for the subtleties of the issue, without forcing editors of existing catalogues to correct their records or accept the "false positives".

Your are kindly invited to use the __Feedback button__ (top right) to let us know if you see major problems if the following changes are applied. You are also invited to comment on the translations, since they are provisional translations with the help of Google translate.

The changes are (in __bold__) the addition of the concept __blessed__ (i.e. "_beati_") to the definition of __11H__. Since the concept implies both male and female, the gender distinction between male and female blessed and saints does not have to be repeated at the next more specific level.

If it is really necessary to explicitly identify (the image of) a person as of someone who is beatified but not (yet) canonized, a [_structural digit_](https://iconclass.org/help/basics#struct) is added that allows you to make the distinction.
