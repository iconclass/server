[98B(CAESAR)68](https://test.iconclass.org/98B(CAESAR)68){:target="_read"}  jumps to the correct notation in the tree, but the concept does not appear on the right until you click the tree. 

Clicking [98B(CAESAR)](https://test.iconclass.org/98B(CAESAR)){:target="_read"} in the path then does not find the notation in the tree...

[11H(ADRIAN)68](https://test.iconclass.org/11H(ADRIAN)68){:target="_read"}  almost the same story.
Difference being that clicking [11H(ADRIAN)](https://test.iconclass.org/11H(ADRIAN)){:target="_read"} in the path does find the notation in the tree
