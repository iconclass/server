# CHAPTER: Leonardo da Vinci

And he practised not one branch of art only, but all those in which drawing played a part; and having an intellect so divine and marvellous that he was also an excellent geometrician, he not only worked in sculpture, making in his youth, in clay, some [heads of women that are smiling](/31A221) [#](/31D15) [#](/31B62313), of which plaster casts are still taken, and likewise some [heads of boys](/31A221) [#](/31D11221) which appeared to have issued from the hand of a master; but in architecture, also, he made many drawings both of [ground-plans](/48C1423) and of other [designs of buildings](/48C142) and he was the first, although but a youth, who suggested the plan of reducing the river Arno to a navigable canal from Pisa to Florence.

Truly marvellous and celestial was Leonardo, the son of Ser Piero da Vinci; and in learning and in the rudiments of letters he would have made great proficience, if he had not been so variable and unstable, for he set himself to learn many things, and then, after having begun them, abandoned them.

He was placed, then, as has been said, in his boyhood, at the instance of Ser Piero, to learn art with Andrea del Verrocchio, who was making a panel-picture of [S. John baptizing Christ](/73C121), when Leonardo painted an [angel who was holding some garments](/11G1926) [#](/41D2) and although he was but a lad, Leonardo executed it in such a manner that his angel was much better than the figures of Andrea; which was the reason that Andrea would never again touch colour, in disdain that a child should know more than he.

And among these [models and designs](/48C142), there was one by which he often demonstrated to many ingenious citizens, who were then governing Florence, how he proposed to raise the Temple of S. Giovanni in Florence, and place steps under it, without damaging the building; and with such strong reasons did he urge this, that it appeared possible, although each man, after he had departed, would recognize for himself the impossibility of so vast an undertaking.

He was commissioned to make a cartoon for a door-hanging that was to be executed in Flanders, woven in gold and silk, to be sent to the King of Portugal, of [Adam and Eve sinning in the Earthly Paradise](/71A42) wherein Leonardo drew with the brush in chiaroscuro, with the lights in lead-white, a [meadow of infinite kinds of herbage](/71A321), with some [animals](/25F), of which, in truth, it may be said that for diligence and truth to nature divine wit could not make it so perfect.

Leonardo then made a picture of [Our Lady](/11F) [#](/11F4), a most excellent work, which was in the possession of Pope Clement VII; and, among other things painted therein, he counterfeited a [glass vase full of water, containing some flowers](/41A6711), in which, besides its marvellous naturalness, he had imitated the [dew-drops on the flowers](/26B3) [#](/25G41), so that it seemed more real than the reality.

It is among the rare works of art in the Palace of Duke Cosimo, together with the [head of an angel](11G) [#](/31A221), who is raising [one arm in the air, which, coming forward, is foreshortened from the shoulder to the elbow](/31A2512%28%2B1%29) [#](/31A2511%28%2B1%29), and with the other he [raises the hand to the breast](/31A25161).

For Antonio Segni, who was very much his friend, he made, on a sheet of paper, a [Neptune](/92H1) executed with such careful draughtsmanship that it seemed absolutely alive.

He began a panel-picture of the [Adoration of the Magi](/73B57), containing many beautiful things, particularly [the heads](/31A221), which was in the house of Amerigo Benci, opposite the Loggia de' Peruzzi; and this, also, remained unfinished, like his other works.

It came to pass that Giovan Galeazzo, Duke of Milan, being dead, and Lodovico Sforza raised to the same rank, in the year 1494, Leonardo was summoned to Milan in great repute to the Duke, who took much delight in the sound of the lyre, to the end that he might play it: and Leonardo took with him that [instrument which he had made with his own hands, in great part of silver, in the form of a horse's skull](/46C13141%28%2B7331%29) [#](/48C7321)--a thing bizarre and new--in order that the harmony might be of greater volume and more sonorous in tone; with which he surpassed all the musicians who had come together there to play.

He also painted in Milan, for the Friars of S. Dominic, at S. Maria delle Grazie, a [Last Supper](/73D24), a most beautiful and marvellous thing; and to the [heads of the Apostles](/11I321) [#](/31A221) he gave such majesty and beauty, that he left [the head of Christ](/11D31) unfinished, not believing that he was able to give it that divine air which is essential to the [image of Christ](/11D31).

And so the poor Prior, in confusion, confined himself to urging on the work in the garden, and left Leonardo in peace, who finished only the [head of Judas](/11I72%28JUDAS ISCARIOT%29) [#](/31A221), which seems the very embodiment of treachery and inhumanity; but that of Christ, as has been said, remained unfinished.

In the same refectory, while he was working at the Last Supper, on the end wall where is [a Passion](/73D) in the old manner, Leonardo portrayed the said [Lodovico, with Massimiliano, his eldest son](/61B2%28LODOVICO SFORZA%2912) [#](/61B2%28MASSIMILIANO SFORZA%29)12 [#](/42B7411); and, on the other side, the Duchess [Beatrice, with Francesco](/61BB2%28BEATRICE SFORZA%2912) [#](/61B2%28FRANCESCO SFORZA%2912) [#](/42B7421), their other son, both of whom afterwards became Dukes of Milan; and all are portrayed divinely well.

He then applied himself, but with greater care, to the [anatomy of man](/31A2), assisted by and in turn assisting, in this research, Messer Marc' Antonio della Torre, an excellent philosopher, who was then lecturing at Pavia, and who wrote of this matter; and he was one of the first (as I have heard tell) that began to illustrate the [problems of medicine with the doctrine of Galen](/49G61), and to throw true light on anatomy, which up to that time had been wrapped in the thick and gross darkness of ignorance.

And to return to the works of Leonardo; there came to Milan, in his time, the King of France, wherefore Leonardo being asked to devise some bizarre thing, made a [lion which walked several steps](</25FF23(LION)%28%2B5211%29>) and then [opened its breast](/25FF23%28LION%29%28%2B32%29) [#](/25FF23%28LION%29%28%2B323%29), and showed it [full of lilies](/25G41%28LILY%29%28%2B1%29).

In Milan he took for his assistant the Milanese Salai, who was most comely in grace and beauty, having fine locks, curling in ringlets, in which Leonardo greatly delighted; and he taught him many things of art; and certain works in Milan, which are said to be by Salai, were retouched by Leonardo.

In the end, he made a cartoon containing a [Madonna and a S. Anne, with a Christ](/73A221#73B8311), which not only caused all the craftsmen to marvel, but, when it was finished, men and women, young and old, continued for two days to flock for a sight of it to the room where it was, as if to a solemn festival, in order to gaze at the marvels of Leonardo, which caused all those people to be amazed; for in the face of that Madonna was seen whatever of the simple and the beautiful can by simplicity and beauty confer grace on a picture of the [Mother of Christ](/11F4), since he wished to show that modesty and that humility which are looked for in an image of the Virgin, supremely content with gladness at seeing the beauty of her Son, whom she was holding with tenderness in her lap, while with most chastened gaze she was looking down at [S. John, as a little boy, who was playing with a lamb](</73C113(+0)>); not without a [smile from S. Anne](</11HH(ANNA)#31B62313>), who, overflowing with joy, was beholding her earthly progeny become divine--ideas truly worthy of the brain and genius of Leonardo.

He returned to Florence, where he found that the Servite Friars had entrusted to Filippino the painting of the panel for the high-altar of the Nunziata; whereupon Leonardo said that he would willingly have done such a work.

And it was decided between the Gonfalonier and the chief citizens, the Great Council Chamber having been newly built--the architecture of which had been contrived with the judgment and counsel of Giuliano da San Gallo, Simone Pollaiuolo, called Il Cronaca, Michelagnolo Buonarroti, and Baccio d' Agnolo, as will be related with more detail in the proper places--and having been finished in great haste, it was ordained by public decree that Leonardo should be given some beautiful work to paint; and so the said hall was allotted to him by Piero Soderini, then Gonfalonier of Justice.

Leonardo undertook to execute, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of [Monna Lisa](/61BB2%28MONA+LISA%2911), his wife; and after toiling over it for four years, he left it unfinished; and the work is now in the collection of King Francis of France, at Fontainebleau.

He went to Rome with Duke Giuliano de' Medici, at the election of Pope Leo, who spent much of his time on philosophical studies, and particularly on alchemy; where, forming a paste of a certain kind of wax, as he walked he shaped [animals very thin and full of wind](</25F#43C7241(+0)>), and, by blowing into them, made them fly through the air, but when the wind ceased they fell to the ground.

Whereupon Leonardo, determining to execute this work, began a cartoon in the Sala del Papa, an apartment in S. Maria Novella, [representing the story of Niccolo Piccinino, Captain of Duke Filippo of Milan; wherein he designed a group of horsemen who were fighting for a standard](/45H3%28%2B22%29) [#](/61A%281440$29) [#](/61I%28BATTLE OF ANGHIARI%29) [#](/61B2%28NICCOLO PICCININO%293), a work that was held to be very excellent and of great mastery, by reason of the marvellous ideas that he had in composing that battle.

There was very great disdain between Michelagnolo Buonarroti and him, on account of which Michelagnolo departed from Florence, with the excuse of Duke Giuliano, having been summoned by the Pope to the competition for the facade of S. Lorenzo.

He made at this time, for Messer Baldassarre Turini da Pescia, who was Datary to Pope Leo, a little picture of the Madonna with the Child in her arms, with infinite diligence and art; but whether through the fault of whoever primed the panel with gesso, or because of his innumerable and capricious mixtures of grounds and colours, it is now much spoilt.

And so, on account of all his qualities, so many and so divine, although he worked much more by words than by deeds, his name and fame can never be extinguished; wherefore it was thus said in his praise by Messer Giovan Battista Strozzi: Vince costui pur solo Tutti altri; e vince Fidia e vince Apelle E tutto il lor vittorioso stuolo.

And in statuary, he proved his worth in the three figures of bronze that are over the door of S. Giovanni, on the side towards the north, executed by Giovan Francesco Rustici, but contrived with the advice of Leonardo; which are the most beautiful pieces of casting, the best designed, and the most perfect that have as yet been seen in modern days.

Another (of his disciples) was Marco Oggioni, who painted, in S. Maria della Pace, the Passing of Our Lady and the Marriage of Cana in Galilee.

A disciple of Leonardo was Giovan Antonio Boltraffio of Milan, a person of great skill and understanding, who, in the year 1500, painted with much diligence, for the Church of the Misericordia, without Bologna, a panel in oils containing Our Lady with the Child in her arms, S. John the Baptist, S. Sebastian naked, and the patron who caused it to be executed, portrayed from the life, on his knees--a truly beautiful work, on which he wrote his name, calling himself a disciple of Leonardo.

# Chapter: Cimabue

By reason of these works, then, the name of Cimabue being very famous everywhere, he was brought to Assisi, a city of Umbria, where, in company with certain Greek masters, in the lower Church of S. Francesco, he painted part of the vaulting, and on the walls the life of Jesus Christ and that of S. Francis.

# Chapter: Masaccio

He began painting at the time when Masolino da Panicale was working on the Chapel of the Brancacci in the Carmine, in Florence, ever following, in so far as he was able, in the steps of Filippo and Donato, although their branch of art was different, and seeking continually in his work to make his figures very lifelike and with a beautiful liveliness in the likeness of nature.

# Chapter: Sandro Botticelli

The best of these that is to be seen by his hand is the Triumph of the Faith effected by Fra Girolamo Savonarola of Ferrara, of whose sect he was so ardent a partisan that he was thereby induced to desert his painting, and, having no income to live on, fell into very great distress.

# Chapter: GIULLANO and ANTONIO GALLO

There had arrived in Rome, about that time, the architect Bramante of Castel Durante, who had been in Lombardy; and he went to work in such a manner, with various extraordinary means and methods of his own, and with his fantastic ideas, having on his side Baldassarre Peruzzi, Raffaello da Urbino, and other architects, that he put the whole undertaking into confusion; whereby much time was consumed in discussions.

# Chapter: ANDREA DEL SARTO

Having finished that work, which is certainly well worthy of all praise, he painted for the General of Vallombrosa a panel-picture with four very lovely figures, S. John the Baptist, S. Giovanni Gualberto, founder of that Order, S. Michelagnolo, and S. Bernardo, a Cardinal and a monk of the Order, with some little boys in the centre that could not be more vivacious or more beautiful.

# Chapter: Pierino del Vaga

There came to Florence at that time the Florentine painter Vaga, a master of no great excellence, who was executing commonplace works at Toscanella in the province of Rome.

# Chapter: Jacopo da Pontormo

In the centre of the vaulting, then, he painted a Saturn with the Sign of Capricorn, and a Hermaphrodite Mars in the Sign of the Lion and of the Virgin, and some little Angels who are flying through the air, like those of Careggi.

# Chapter: Jacopo Tintoretto

Now, when it had been ordained by the Senate that Jacopo Tintoretto and Paolo Veronese, at that time young men of great promise, should each execute a scene in the Hall of the Great Council, and Orazio, the son of Tiziano, another, Tintoretto painted in his scene Frederick Barbarossa being crowned by the Pope, depicting there a most beautiful building, and about the Pontiff a great number of Cardinals and Venetian gentlemen, all portrayed from life, and at the foot the Pope's chapel of music.

# Chapter: Michealangelo Buonarroti

The talent of Michelagnolo was then clearly recognized by a Roman gentleman named Messer Jacopo Galli, an ingenious person, who caused him to make a Cupid of marble as large as life, and then a figure of a Bacchus ten palms high, who has a cup in the right hand, and in the left hand the skin of a tiger, with a bunch of grapes at which a little satyr is trying to nibble.

# Chapter: Giorgio Vasari

And besides the proficience that I made in drawing the vaulting and chapel of Michelagnolo, there remained nothing of Raffaello, Polidoro, and Baldassarre da Siena, that I did not likewise draw in company with Francesco Salviati, as has been told already in his Life.
