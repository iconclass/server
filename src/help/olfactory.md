## The iconography of smell

It may sound paradoxical at first - the _iconography_ of a phenomenon you cannot _see_ - but even a very cursory glance at the most [basic Iconclass concept for smell and smelling](https://test.iconclass.org/31A33){:target="_read"} will tell you that heritage collections are guarding a treasure trove of information about smells and scents waiting to be explored. Although in its original state Iconclass already included a useful set of tools to give access to the olfactory contents of images, there is ample room for improvement. Improvement consists of adapting and fine-tuning existing concepts but also expanding the schedules with new terms. Both will be discussed below.

#### Olfactory concepts in Iconclass

What does a _smell_ look like? How is _smelling_ visualized? How are _olfactory aspects_ of classical myths or biblical stories translated into images? How do artists convey the _fragrance_ of an object or a process they paint or draw?
Those are only a few of the questions that a novice in the field of olfactory studies like me, could ask. They are raised here to give us some pointers when we try to locate concepts in Iconclass that may be useful to record olfactory information. 
Looking for those concepts also gives us a chance to test the search algoritms and the retrieval options of the new Iconclass browser. Testing them on an unlikely subject like the imagery of smell thus serves a double purpose.

##### Sender - receiver - message

As all agents of communication _smell_ is bi-directional. Put simply, phenomena like people, animals, objects, and processes can _produce_ a scent and actors like people, animals (and machines) can _smell_ them. Visualizing _smell_ can show the origin (sender) of a scent, for example a bunch of flowers or a dirty nappy; and it can show the receiver of the scent, for example Cupid smelling a rose or a father holding his nose when his wife is wiping his toddler's bottom. Showing the "message" itself - the agent that actually gives off a scent - is also an option, for example in the shape of vapour rising from a cooking pot, as in this emblem _pictura_ about the emptiness (_Vanitas_) of a sweet smell (_Vom lieblichen Geruch_).

##### Smell as one of the (five) senses

In Iconclass the concept __31A33 smell, smelling__ is included among the (five) senses, a narrower term subordinated to __31 man in a general biological sense__, a concept definition that immediately reminds us how casually a word like __man__ was used in the years between 1973 and 1985 when Iconclass was first published.
