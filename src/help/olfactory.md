## The iconography of smell

It may sound paradoxical at first - the _iconography_ of a phenomenon you cannot _see_ - but even a very cursory glance at the most [basic Iconclass concept for smell and smelling](https://test.iconclass.org/31A33){:target="_read"} will tell you that heritage collections are guarding a treasure trove of information about smells and scents waiting to be explored. Although in its original state Iconclass already included a useful set of tools to give access to the olfactory contents of images, there is ample room for improvement. Improvement consists of adapting and fine-tuning existing concepts but also expanding the schedules with new terms. Both will be discussed below.

#### Olfactory concepts in Iconclass

What does a _smell_ look like? How is _smelling_ visualized? How are _olfactory aspects_ of classical myths or biblical stories translated into images? How do artists convey the _fragrance_ of an object or a process they paint or draw?
Those are only a few of the questions that a novice in the field of olfactory studies like me, could ask. They are raised here to give us some pointers when we try to locate concepts in Iconclass that may be useful to record olfactory information. 
Looking for those concepts also gives us a chance to test the search algoritms and the retrieval options of the new Iconclass browser. Testing them on an unlikely subject like the imagery of smell thus serves a double purpose.

##### Sender - receiver - message

As all agents of communication _smell_ is bi-directional. Put simply, phenomena like people, animals, objects, and processes can _produce_ a scent and actors like people, animals (and machines) can _smell_ them. Visualizing _smell_ can show the origin (sender) of a scent, for example a bunch of flowers or a dirty nappy; and it can show the receiver of the scent, for example Cupid smelling a rose or a father holding his nose when his wife is wiping his toddler's bottom. Showing the "message" itself - the agent that actually gives off a scent - is also an option, for example in the shape of vapours filling a kitchen, as in this emblem _pictura_ about the [emptiness (_Vanitas_) of a sweet smell (_Vom lieblichen Geruch_)](http://emblematica.library.illinois.edu/detail/emblem/E013139){:target="_read"}.

##### Smell (Olfactus) as one of the (five) senses
In Iconclass the concept __31A33 smell, smelling__ is included among the (five) senses, which is a narrower term for __31 man in a general biological sense__, which immediately reminds us how casually a word like "__man__" is used in the concept definitions of Iconclass - a further indication of the editorial work that lies ahead. 
Here a series of personifications of the senses by Georg Pencz, commented on in detail by [Carl Nordenfalk](http://www.jstor.org/stable/751209){:target="_read"}. The sense of Smell is represented by a girl holding a cornucopia to her nose, with flowers and flasks in the room, and a vulture at her feet.

Using __smell__ as an obvious first keyword to locate concepts in Iconclass we find 11 results, but most of them are simply more detailed variants of the basic concept __31A33 smell, smelling__. The other two are a landscape motif and a story from classical history:


          31A33 · smell, smelling (one of the five senses)
            25H172 · 'locus amoenus' motif; pleasant place with trees (~ taste), meadows (~ sight), spring
                     or brook (~ feeling), singing birds (~ hearing) and flowers (~ smell)
            98B(DUILIUS, C.)51 · Bilia, being rebuked by her husband Gaius Duilius, justifies herself by 
                     saying 'Dixissem tibi nisi putassem, omnibus viris os olere'

The concept is "parent" term to three "children": __Odorato__, __agreeable smell__, and __disagreeable smell__. We also see that when the notation is used with the double letter __- AA -__ the meaning of the concept has a _female connotation_, which is not specified.

_Smell_ is of course only one of the possible keywords to retrieve olfactory concepts from the Iconclass schedules, so we can try to cast the net a little wider with multiple (truncated) keywords in a Boolean __OR__ combination:

          {{% aimg olfa_smell_kw %}}

Two of these keywords - _stench_ and _odour_ - are not used at all in Iconclass, so adding them would be a first useful expansion of the retrieval options.
The keyword _scent_ retrieves two sets of concepts from branches of the system that are quite distinct. It is easy to imagine that pictures to which these concepts could be applied, look quite similar. Hence a cross reference was added from __41C76__ to __31A514__.

          {{% aimg olfa_41C76 %}}

Adding a reverse cross reference here would be an improvement of the system, albeit a small one.

          {{% aimg olfa_31A514 %}}
          
A more substantial improvement of the system could perhaps be found in the expansion of the first of these concepts __41C76 · scents, perfumes ~ stimulants, drugs__ with the option to add the _name_ of a specific substance. However, we already have the option to add _named substances_ to the following notations: __31A5141(...) · scents (with NAME)__ and __31A5142(...) · perfumes (with NAME)__ so the question would be whether this would really be a useful expansion or a possible source of confusion. It would be helpful to have some specialist advice here to determine whether _different_ groups of named substances could actually be created for these two concepts.
A similar potential confusion could arise when we look at the gestures that involve hands and noses.
