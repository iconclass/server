## The iconography of smell

It may sound paradoxical at first - the _iconography_ of a phenomenon you cannot _see_ - but even a very cursory glance at the most [basic Iconclass concept for smell and smelling](https://test.iconclass.org/31A33){:target="_read"} will tell you that heritage collections are guarding a treasure trove of information about smells and scents waiting to be explored. Although in its original state Iconclass already included a useful set of tools to give access to the olfactory contents of images, there is ample room for improvement. Improvement consists of adapting and fine-tuning existing concepts but also expanding the schedules with new terms. Both will be discussed below.

#### Olfactory concepts in Iconclass

What does a _smell_ look like? How is _smelling_ visualized? How are _olfactory aspects_ of classical myths or biblical stories translated into images? How do artists convey the _fragrance_ of an object or a process they paint or draw?
Those are only a few of the questions that a novice in the field of olfactory studies like me, could ask. They are raised here to give us some pointers when we try to locate concepts in Iconclass that may be useful to record olfactory information. 
Looking for those concepts also gives us a chance to test the search algoritms and the retrieval options of the new Iconclass browser. Testing them on an unlikely subject like the imagery of smell thus serves a double purpose.

##### Sender - receiver - message

As all agents of communication _smell_ is bi-directional. Put simply, phenomena like people, animals, objects, and processes can _produce_ a scent and actors like people, animals (and machines) can _smell_ them. Visualizing _smell_ can show the origin (sender) of a scent, for example a bunch of flowers or a dirty nappy; and it can show the receiver of the scent, for example Cupid smelling a rose or a father holding his nose when his wife is wiping his toddler's bottom. Showing the "message" itself - the agent that actually gives off a scent - is also an option, for example in the shape of vapours filling a kitchen, as in this emblem _pictura_ about the [emptiness (_Vanitas_) of a sweet smell (_Vom lieblichen Geruch_)](http://emblematica.library.illinois.edu/detail/emblem/E013139){:target="_read"}.

##### Smell (Olfactus) as one of the (five) senses
In Iconclass the concept __31A33 smell, smelling__ is included among the (five) senses, a narrower term for __31 man in a general biological sense__, which immediately reminds us how casually a word like "__man__" is used in the concept definitions of Iconclass - a further indication of the editorial work that lies ahead. 
The __five senses__ can be represented together as a series of personifications. A well-known example is this series of engravings by Georg Pencz, studied in detail by [Carl Nordenfalk](http://www.jstor.org/stable/751209){:target="_read"}. The sense of __Smell (olfactus)__ - in the centre - is represented by a girl holding a cornucopia to her nose, with flowers and flasks in the room, and a vulture at her feet.

{{% aimg 31A3 %}}

The concept __31A33 smell, smelling (one of the five senses)__ is found in the Iconclass schedules with the help of the obvious keyword __smell__. It is a broader or "parent" term to three "children": __31A330 Odorato__, __31A331 agreeable smell__, and __31A332 disagreeable smell__. We also see that the notation can be used with the double letter __- AA -__. 

          {{% aimg olfa_31A33 %}}

As is often the case in Iconclass, the [letter duplication](basics#double){:target="_read"} expresses an opposite or supplementary meaning. Here it would add "female human figure" in a fairly generic sense to the meaning of __31A33 smell, smelling__.

##### Edits affect searching, browsing _and_ retrieval

__Smell__ is an obvious, but by no means the only possible _keyword_ to retrieve olfactory concepts from the Iconclass schedules. Precisely because _smell_ is an invisble, implied aspect of many concepts across the whole Iconclass system, we should be creative when coming up with keywords to retrieve concepts associated with _smell_. It obviously helps when you are familiar with Iconclass; here are some candidate keywords:

          {{% aimg keywords_smell %}}

We could try these keywords one by one, or combine a few in a Boolean __OR__ combination. One of the things we would notice, is that not all of the keywords are already used in Iconclass. _Stench_ and _odour_ are examples of common olfactory words that do not produce a hit from the system. So, adding words like that could be part of a strategy to expand the retrieval options. _Stench_ could be added as a keyword to the concept __31A332 disagreeable, repellent smell__. It seems like a good idea, for example, to also add _stench_ to phenomena that spread a repellent odour, like __25I171 sewers__.
If we do, images that are tagged with __25I171__ because they show a sewer, would automatically become retrievable through the keyword _stench_. A satirical drawing like this one from Punch magazine, referring to the [_Great Stink_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Stink){:target="_read"} of London in 1858, with the personified river Thames leaning on a sewer pipe, is a good example.

          {{% aimg thames1858 %}}
However, a direct reference from the keyword _stench_ to a concept that is _implicitly_ associated with a bad odour, could also make tagging such a picture with the _explicit_ concept __31A332 disagreeable, repellent smell__ seem superfluous or too time-consuming. Failing to do so would mean that researchers who are browsing that branch of the schedules instead of searching with keywords, would miss the reference.
So, an alternative option might be to add _stench_ as a keyword to __31A332__ and create a cross reference at the conceptual level, i.e. from __31A332__ to __25I171__. It would mean that when the Punch illustration is tagged with the first term, users would also be referred to the second.

Whatever we choose, this example is a useful reminder that editorial decisions have consequences for __searching, browsing__ and __retrieval__, so all aspects should be taken into account.
          
       
_Odour_ could be added as a synonym for the preferred keyword _scent_, once the list of related, non-preferred keywords is activated again in the new browser. It would simply mean that whenever _odour_  is used as a keyword, a clickable cross reference to _scent_ is shown.

At present, the keyword _scent_ retrieves two concepts from different branches of the system, children of the parent terms __41C7 drinks, stimulants, drugs__ and __31A51 making toilet__. Both branches have terms dealing with __scents and perfumes__ and we can expect those to be used for visually similar images. When there is a likelihood of visual similarity, it is a fairly common practice in Iconclass to link concepts. Hence a cross reference to __31A514__ was added to __41C76 scents, perfumes ~ stimulants, drugs__.

          {{% aimg olfa_41C76 %}}

A simple juxtaposition of two notations in the appropriate Iconclass datafile, suffices to set up a cross reference in the browser. It works as a simple reminder to also look elsewhere in the system, and it would be very easy to add a reverse link to __31A514__ which at present is lacking.

#### Adding bracketed texts

With the addition of a new keyword like _stench_, a new synonym like _odour_, or a new cross reference, e.g. to __31A514__, the toolbox to enrich Iconclass is not exhausted.
Throughout the system there has always been ample room for the inclusion of alphabetically organized lists. This [__bracketed text__](basics#brackets){:target="_read"} option is available for some of the subdivisions of __31A5141__, allowing specific __NAMES__ of substances or fragrances to be embedded in the notation.

          31A5141(...) · scents (with NAME)
          31A5142(...) · perfumes (with NAME)

The latter could be supplemented with the names of perfumes found in advertisements of the early 20th century, like __31A5142(MUSKY)__ or __31A5142(LA BOHÈME)__:

{{% aimg perfume_names %}}

As a rule bracketed texts like __MUSKY__ are only used in local databases. They are not added to the central Iconclass datafiles, so there is some editorial freedom as to what type of names are entered between the brackets.
Two of the subdivisions that are "siblings" of __scents__ and __perfumes__ do not yet offer the __(with NAME)__ option, but that can be easily fixed:

          31A5143 · ointments
          31A5144 · powder ~ making toilet
          
One or more subdivisions for bracketed texts could also be added to __41C76 · scents, perfumes ~ stimulants, drugs__ which at present has only two "children".

#### Olfactory gestures

Gestures with an olfactory connotation by default involve both the hand and the nose. Iconclass contains two more or less synonymous concepts. __31A25351 · holding one's nose__ is one of the possible movements of the hand towards the face. __31B6222 · holding one's nose closed__ is an example of the morphology of facial expressions. Because of their potential for visual similarity it makes sense to add cross references to both.
The obvious connotation is a negative one: the nose is pinched because of a repellent smell. Usually a narrative context clarifies the cause of the smell, as in the scene of the raising of Lazarus, or the [emblem dealing with the body's decomposition](http://emblematica.library.illinois.edu/detail/emblem/E010109){:target="_read"}.

{{% aimg gestures %}}

__31A2531(+933) · hand(s) bent towards the head (+ holding something)__ is a concept describing a more neutral gesture which often involves an object, such as the flower here held up by the woman to the nose of the man in Goltzius' personification of _Smell_.

#### Olfactory information implied in narratives

When Isaac blesses his deceitful son Jacob (Genesis 27:27-29), this is how he starts (in the King James translation): "_the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed_". In Iconclass the scene is described as follows __71C274 · Isaac lying in bed blesses Jacob who, disguised in Esau's clothes, brings food to his father; Jacob's hands and neck are covered with goatskins__
In other words, in Iconclass the visual aspect is made explicit - _clothes and goatskins_ - but the aspect of smell, crucial though it may have been - is kept implicit.
The story of Jacob and Esau is only one example of a narrative with an implied olfactory aspect. To make it explicit and retrievable we have two options. The concept definition could be edited in such a way that the element of smell is added to the text: "_Isaac lying in bed blesses Jacob who, disguised in Esau's clothes_ __to imitate the touch and scent of his brother__, _brings food to his father_...".
__Scent__ could also be added as a keyword to retrieve the concept in searches.

Sometimes olfactory aspects are mentioned quite casually in a narrative, but they can still be visualized and invite further research questions, as the conical baskets do that are carried by the camels in this representation of Genesis 37:25 "_As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt._
