## The iconography of smell

#### Olfactory concepts in Iconclass

What does a _smell_ look like? How is _smelling_ visualized? How are _olfactory aspects_ of classical myths or biblical stories translated into images? How do artists convey the _fragrance_ of an object or a process they paint or draw?
Those are only a few of the questions that a non-specialist in the field of _olfactory_ studies like me could ask. They are raised here to give us some pointers when we try to locate concepts in Iconclass that may be useful to record _olfactory_ information. 
Looking for those concepts also gives us a chance to test the search algoritms of the new Iconclass browser, and assess the retrieval options provided by the text of the _concept definitions_ and the _keywords_ that help us find them.

The first, and probably most obvious search is with the word __smell__
