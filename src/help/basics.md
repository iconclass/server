### Iconclass basics

The unique elements of the Iconclass system are its alphanumeric classification codes, called __notations__. Notations always begin with one of the digits 0 - 9, corresponding with the ten main divisions of Iconclass. Notations can be used to describe or index the subjects of visual documents regardless of the complexity of the subjects. Several notations can be used to describe complex subjects. Every notation is part of a hierarchical structure and, as such, incorporates all of its iconographical broader terms. The text explaining the meaning of an Iconclass notation is the notation's '__textual correlate__', the actual definition of the concept.


#### Main divisions of the Iconclass classification system
The main divisions of the Iconclass system are represented by digits 0 to 9. Of these ten 'main divisions', the numbers 1 to 5 are 'general' topics, designed to comprise all the principal aspects of what can be represented. Divisions 6 through 9 accommodate 'special' topics, coherent subject matter of a narrative nature, with an emphasis on the Bible (7) and Classical Mythology (9). A tenth division, represented by the number 0, was added to the digital version in 1996 at the request of Iconclass users, to accommodate abstract art.

      0 Abstract, Non-representational Art
      1 Religion and Magic
      2 Nature
      3 Human being, Man in general
      4 Society, Civilization, Culture
      5 Abstract Ideas and Concepts
      6 History
      7 Bible
      8 Literature
      9 Classical Mythology and Ancient History

#### Subdivisions: Increasing specificity
Within each division of Iconclass, definitions are organized according to a logic of increasing specificity. A main division is divided further into a maximum of nine subdivisions by adding a second digit to the right of the first one. Division 2 Nature, for example, is subdivided in the following way:

      21 the four elements, and ether, the fifth element
      22 natural phenomena
      23 time
      24 the heavens (celestial bodies)
      25 earth, world as celestial body
      26 meteorological phenomena
      29 surrealia, surrealistic representations
The third level of specificity is attained by adding a letter in upper case. For reasons of legibility in the [original printed version of Iconclass](aboutb#iconoriginal), the letter 'J' was omitted. Thus the addition of a letter permits as many as 25 subdivisions instead of 9, and it also increases the legibility of the notations.

* Blank spaces on either side of the capital letter and between successive pairs of digits also provided greater legibility in the printed edition. However, the implementation of notations with 'spaces' causes most algorithms to interpret a notation as a "sentence" of separate words and is therefore advised against.

Take a look, for example, at the subdivisions of [25 earth](https://test.iconclass.org/en/25), world as a celestial body:

      25A maps, atlases
      25B continents represented allegorically
      25C geological phenomena
      25D rock types; minerals and metals; soil types
      25E geological chronological division; historical geology
      25F animals
      25G plants; vegetation
      25H landscapes
      25I city view, and landscape with manmade constructions
      25K landscapes in the non-temperate zone, exotic landscapes
      25L cities represented allegorically or symbolically
      25M the Seven Wonders of the World
From the letter(s) onward, all subsequent descents in the hierarchy take place by extending the notation to the right with more digits.

The following example shows the first subdivision of [25F animals](https://test.iconclass.org/en/25F):

      25F1 groups of animals
      25F2 mammals
      25F3 birds
      25F4 reptiles
      25F5 amphibians
      25F6 fishes
      25F7 lower animals
      25F8 extinct animals
      25F9 misshapen animals; monsters
      25N fictitious countries

#### Hierarchical path
The following example from division 7 Bible shows the hierarchical principle: all subsequent descents in the hierarchy take place by extending the notation to the right with more digits:

      7 Bible
      71 Old Testament
      71H story of David
      71H7 David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12)
      71H71 David, from the roof (or balcony) of his palace, sees Bathsheba bathing
      71H713 Bathsheba receives a letter from David
      {{% aimg 71h713 %}}

#### Auxiliaries
A standard entry in the Iconclass system consists of a notation and its textual correlate. The Iconclass system offers the user additional features to increase the accuracy of meaning of a notation in a more or less systematic way. These features are:

--__Bracketed text__
--__Keys__
--__Doubling of the letter__
--__Structural digits__


#### Bracketed text
Bracketed text is a feature that enables the user to break away from the hierarchy of alphanumeric notations. At certain points in the hierarchy the user is invited, by the phrase: __"with NAME"__ (or an equivalent expression), to add a species name, a proper name, a number, or a combination of these in parentheses to the end of a notation. Thus a non-hierarchical platform is created within the hierarchy.

Example from division 2 of the Iconclass system:

      25G41 flowers
      25G41(...) flowers (with NAME)
      25G41(LILY) flowers: lily
      25G41(ROSE) flowers: rose
Notations that are ready to accept an entry of bracketed text, for example 25G41(..), form an integral part of the Iconclass system. Usually, notations with bracketed text spelled out, for example 25G41(ROSE), are incorporated in the Iconclass Browser only for notations that have literary warrant in the Iconclass Bibliography. However, a large number of proper names of historical persons or fictional characters have found their own place in Iconclass, their life stories can often further subdivided by means of structural digits, for example 11H(BONAVENTURA) or 98B(CAESAR).


#### Keys
Keys are elements of the Iconclass system that are declared in lists. A list of keys is valid for a certain range of notations. Keys are made up of strings of digits, occasionally of digits and word(s). Keys are preceded by the plus "+" sign and placed between brackets. They are placed at the end of a notation and add a 'shade of meaning' to the definition or meaning of the notation proper. Example:

The notation for a lion is 25F23(LION). Keys, valid for notations beginning with 25F, are:

      +1 animals used symbolically
      +11 bestiaries, 'Physiologus'
      +12 heraldic animals
      +2 sex and age of animals; propagation of animals
      ...etc.
Key (+12) adds the notion 'heraldic' to the concept 'lion': the notation for a heraldic lion reads 25F23(LION)(+12)
      {{% aimg 25f23lion12 %}}

#### Queue of key
Certain keys can be expanded with digits from a 'queue'. The keys +1 to +6 of 25FF, for example, all indicating an abnormal part, limb or organ of a fabulous beast, can be expanded with one or more digits from a queue indicating the part or limb affected: 1 head, 11 nose, tusk, etc. Thus 25FF241(+511) denotes a 'unicorn with nose or tusk in an unusual place'. The added part (11) is referred to as "Queue of Key". Some 'queues' are made up of an entire key from a different part of Iconclass.


#### Doubling of letter
At several points, Iconclass offers the option to duplicate the upper case letter of a notation and, in this way, modify its meaning. Letter duplication or doubling the letter is context sensitive: it is valid only for certain parts of the system. Within a declared range, duplication has a specific meaning. Often some kind of opposition is intended. Examples:

      25F animals
      25FF fabulous animals
      31A the (nude) human figure [_male_]*
      31AA the (nude) human figure; female
      42D25 wedding feast, wedding meal [_indoors_]*
      42DD25 wedding feast, wedding meal; out of doors
__* the meaning of 31AA is made explicit as 'female', so 'male' is implied for 31A; in similar fashion 'indoors' is implied for 42D25__
      
#### Structural Digits
Originally, at the time when Iconclass was devised, structural digits were guidelines in structuring the information concerning certain large groups of characters, such as Greek gods, persons from classical history, or male and female saints. All important episodes in a character's lifetime were numbered consecutively with 'structural' digits:

Example (classical gods):

      1 early life
      2 love-affairs
      3 most important deeds
so structural meaning was added to:    

      92B3 (story of) Apollo
      92B32 love-affairs of Apollo
      
Example (saints):

      1 specific aspects
      2 early life
      3 personal devotion
      
      11H(FRANCIS) founder of the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans),
      Francis(cus) of Assisi; possible attributes: book, crucifix, lily, skull, stigmata
      11H(FRANCIS)2 early life of St. Francis of Assisi
      
Structural digits share with key numbers the property of having an intrinsic meaning which is valid only for a particular part of the Iconclass system. Like keys, structural digits are declared in lists, valid for a particular range of the system. Structural digits can be used to make cross-sections through the system which are very interesting from an iconographical point of view. Unlike keys, structural digits are not flagged, but form an integral part of a notation. There are no formal rules to establish that a certain digit is in fact a structural digit, other than the declaration that it is.
