# Privacy

We do not install any third-party trackers or cookies. No, none, not even Google Analytics.

In the coming months we will be improving the server code to maintain a list of queries
performed by users, so that you can find your own queries again.
We will also be making it compulsory to log in with a username and passowrd to use the service. This will among other things be used to request API keys to use the ICONCLASS service as an API, and for saving/cataloguing your own images.

If you have questions or comments, [please get in touch](https://forms.gle/twPq7swQZXmSX46G8)
