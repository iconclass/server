# Join the Iconclass User Community

On June 14th, 2021 the __Henri van de Waal Foundation__ was established. A major objective of the Foundation is to ensure the long-term availability of the online Iconclass system in Open Access.
The online Iconclass Browser has always been a free service and the Foundation wants to keep it that way. However, a service like the Iconclass Browser can only be free to its users on the condition that someone takes care of the costs that in real life are inevitable.
Those costs can be subdivided in two segments: the external costs of keeping the service in the air, i.e. the costs of server hardware, bandwidth, etcetera; and the internal costs of the time invested in creating the software and editing the content.

During the past 20 years both costs have been carried by the small "_Mnemosyne_" partnership (Etienne Posthumus and Hans Brandhorst), responsible for the Iconclass website. The transfer of the responsibility for the Iconclass site to the Foundation was formally endorsed by the Netherlands Institute for Art History in its [letter of November 2021](https://henrivandewaalfoundation.org/Iconclasstransferstatement20211104.pdf){:target="read"}.

To sustain the Iconclass Browser as a free service the Henri van de Waal Foundation needs the active support of the Iconclass user community. With your support we cannot only keep the Browser alive but also [expand its functionalities](https://henrivandewaalfoundation.org/iconclassprospectus.pdf){:target="read"}.
