# API

(Application Programming Interface)

### AKA, using the system programmataically

It is possible to perform searches, and retrieve information on the system [using an API](/docs/).
This is documented using the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification.

To see a list of URLs that can be called, you can [use the /docs link](/docs)

**Please note** at this point no authentication is needed, but in the course of 2022 we plan on adding an API key requirement, to be able to ensure that the system is not abused so that performance stays manageable for all.
