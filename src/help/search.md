## Using the Illustrated Iconclass: Browse & Search  

Those who have been using Iconclass for some time and those who are new to it, will come to this new, illustrated edition with different expectations and different ideas about what it is for and how it works. This explanation therefore needs to take into account two differen user groups.

Initially, of course, this overview of the __Search__ and __Browse__ functionality will make more sense if you have some experience with Iconclass. If that is your case, you may need a little time to adjust to the changes, as with all new versions of software that you are familiar with. Do remember, however, that you have a direct line to the makers of this Iconclass browser system. You will find the __Feedback__ button at the top right hand corner of the browser window. If you have comments or questions, make sure to use it. Your experiences are very valuable to us. If you are new to Iconclass, your experiences are of course no less valuable, as you will look at its functionalities with fresh eyes. The invitation to use the Feedback button is there for you too.


### Search
Assigning an Iconclass concept - or any other standardized term - to an image, is always a secondary step in the creation of subject information. The primary steps in the process are identifying what is in front of your eyes and deciding what information you actually want to convey about it. That will depend on a broad spectrum of parameters - from the purpose and the budget of your project to the depth of your iconographic expertise - and the examples we are using here can only cover a tiny part of that spectrum. Moreover, in actual cataloguing practice the criteria for the selection of details inevitably evolves over time, because you will learn from your observations and simply "see" more as you go along.

##### Old man leaning on a staff

To find concepts to tag the Rembrandt etching that is the first of these pictures - __a poorly dressed old man leaning on a staff__ - a logical point of departure is to search for the words __old__ and __man__. Sorted by __relevance__, these are the first search results: 

          {{% aimg search_oldman %}} 

If you want to see a concept in its context, i.e. in its place in the hierarchy, just click on it, as is illustrated below for __31D16 old man__.

          {{% aimg 31d16 %}}

The concept you select is then shown on the right in a larger font with the notation in red. The concept's _broader terms_ - its "__path__" through the hierarchy, are listed above the selected one, right up to the main category, in this case __3 Human Being, Man in General__. To broaden the search, just click on one of the terms in the path.

Below the _related keywords_, the three narrower terms or "__children__" of __31D16 old man__ are presented. They can be selected with a click if you need a more specific concept.
In addition, the list of available __[keys](basics#keys){:target="_read"}__, is shown, allowing you to add even more detail to  __31D16 old man__.
One of the keys is: __31D16(+5) 路 old man (+ positions (of the human figure))__. Among its further subdivisions we find: __31D16(+52) 路 old man (+ leaning)__, which would be an appropriate tag for our image.


#### Is there a "correct" notation?
If we had started our search not with "__old__" and "__man__" but with "__leaning__", the result would of course have been different:

          {{% aimg 31a232_8 %}} 

The concept __31A232 leaning figure__ itself can also be made more specific with another key, as highlighted in the screenshot above. This makes it possible to create an alternative tag for the same subject:
__31A232(+813) 路 leaning figure (+ old male (human being))__.
"Synonyms" like this raise the question whether one of the options is the "__correct__" one. And while neither of the alternatives is intrinsically correct or incorrect, there are practical considerations that may help you decide which one will better suit your purpose.
The first consideration is a simple, internal one: "Will it be more useful, given your research question or your collection, to create a group under _leaning figure_  or under _old man_? Remember that creating groups of related images is the whole idea of classification...
The second consideration is an external one: "What have others done?" To help you with that question, we are now _illustrating_ Iconclass. The sample images will not offer a _ready-made_ answer, but they may point you in a direction. We always advise you to explore the databases from which they were selected, as it will help you get a feeling for the broader context your examples will join.
A final consideration may also play its part: you don't _have to choose_. Other than the fact that it is more time consuming, there is no real reason why you should not tag an image with "synonymic" notations, if that enriches the information you provide to your users.

Here are two small sets of pictures to illustrate the principle:

          {{% aimg 31a232 %}} 
       
This first set gives priority to __31A232 leaning figure__ and shows several variations of this posture. To express [connotations of the posture](/en/31A232(+9)) keys from the __(+9)__ section could be added.

          {{% aimg 31d16_5 %}} 

The second set gives priority to  __31D16 路 old man__ and with the __(+5)__ keys the different postures - sitting, crouching, kneeling, leaning, lying down - could be addressed.

On the [Rijksmuseum website](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/RP-P-OB-245){:target="_read"} a different angle was chosen for the description of the etching. Its English caption reads "Beggar in a high cap, standing and leaning on a stick". Although it is an interesting question whether we first "see" a poorly dressed old man and only afterwards "interpret" this as a beggar, the reason to refer to this caption is much more practical. A search for __beggar__ offers an opportunity to show the use of a Boolean condition when doing a search in Iconclass.
The screenshot below shows the result of a straightforward search for __beggar__: 260 hits with a large number of references to saints.

          {{% aimg beggar001 %}} 

To exclude references to __saints__ from the search result, simply use the word NOT (in capitals) as a token for a Boolean condition. What remains is a much shorter list which is easier to scan.

          {{% aimg beggar002 %}} 

Playing around with keywords for searching, using words you notice in the search results, can be an efficient way to filter those results. Another way to filter the list is by using Iconclass notations. In this particular case __beggar NOT 11H__ would lead to the same result. This will obviously come more easily when you are more familiar with the Iconclass schedules, but paying attention to the notations in the search results will quickly get you there.

### Browse

Browsing the tree of concepts is a straightforward process: clicking on a concept causes it to "open" and to show its hierarchical "children". A red line marks 


### Sample searches

Only show items from notation 5, the bible:

`5`

If you want to _exclude_ something, this could be handy:

`((?<!11D).)*$` and this will filter out all notations that start with "11D"
