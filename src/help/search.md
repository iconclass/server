## Using the Illustrated Iconclass: Browse & Search  

Those who have been using Iconclass for some time and those who are new to it, will come to this new, illustrated edition with different expectations and different ideas about what it is for and how it works. This explanation therefore aims to take into account two differen user groups.

Initially, of course, this overview of the __Search__ and __Browse__ functionality will make more sense if you have some experience with Iconclass. If that is your case, you still may need a little time to adjust to the changes, as with all new versions of software that you are familiar with. Do remember, however, that you have a direct line to the makers of this Iconclass browser system. You will find the __Feedback__ button at the top right hand corner of the browser window. If you have comments or questions, make sure to use it. Your experiences are very valuable to us. If you are new to Iconclass, your experiences are of course no less valuable, as you will look at its functionalities with fresh eyes. The invitation to use the Feedback button is there for you too.

### But first...: register, to see the illustrations
To take full advantage of this _Illustrated edition of Iconclass_ you should __register__. It is simple and it is free and it will enable us to respond to you if you have comments or questions and use the Feedback button.

{{% aimg register %}}

If you have registered and are logged in, you will see your user name (email address) appear in the top right hand corner,

{{% aimg register2 %}}

but, more importantly, you will see the illustrations that we have added to the browser for comparison and inspiration. The illustrations shown for a particular concept are selected when an __exactly matching notation__ is found in the partner databases as a tag for pictures. Our example - __23A allegory of Time and Eternity__ - has been used to tag 31 images. By default all images are shown in the _Illustrated Iconclass_, except when there is a very rich harvest for a particular concept. In that case a random selection is shown.

### Searching & Browsing
Assigning Iconclass concepts to an image is always a secondary step in the creation of subject information. The primary steps in the process are identifying what is in front of your eyes and deciding what information you actually want to convey about it. That will depend on a broad spectrum of parameters - from the purpose and the budget of your project to the depth of your iconographic expertise - and the examples we are using here can only cover a tiny part of that spectrum. Moreover, in actual cataloguing practice your criteria for the selection of details will inevitably evolve over time, because you will learn from your observations and simply "see" more as you go along.

#### People - _Old man leaning on a staff_

To find concepts to tag this etching by Rembrandt - __a poorly dressed old man leaning on a staff__ - a point of departure could be to search with the words __old__ and __man__. The results of a search are presented in a scrollable list, sorted by relevance or by [notation](basics#notations){:target="_read"}.
Sorted by __relevance__, these are the first search results: 

          {{% aimg search_oldman %}} 

The next step would be to check the context of a candidate concept, i.e. to see its place in the hierarchy and its 'siblings' which may also suit your purpose. To do so, just click on it, as is illustrated below for __31D16 old man__.

          {{% aimg 31d16 %}}

The concept you click on is then shown on the right in a larger font with the notation in red. The concept's _broader terms_ - its "__path__" through the hierarchy - are listed above the selected one, right up to the main category, in this case __3 Human Being, Man in General__. To widen the search, just click on one of the broader terms in the path.

Below the _related keywords_, the three narrower terms or "__children__" of __31D16 old man__ are presented. They can be selected with a click if you need a more specific concept.
In addition, the list of available __[keys](basics#keys){:target="_read"}__, is shown, allowing you to add even more detail to  __31D16 old man__.
One of the keys is: __31D16(+5) · old man (+ positions (of the human figure))__. Among its further subdivisions we find: __31D16(+52) · old man (+ leaning)__, which would be an appropriate tag for our image.


##### Is there a "correct" notation?
If we had started our search not with "__old__" and "__man__" but with "__leaning__", the result would of course have been different:

          {{% aimg 31a232_8 %}} 

The concept __31A232 leaning figure__ itself can also be made more specific with another key, as highlighted in the screenshot above. This makes it possible to create an alternative tag for the same subject:
__31A232(+813) · leaning figure (+ old male (human being))__.
"Synonyms" like this raise the question whether one of the options is the "__correct__" one. And while neither of the alternatives is intrinsically correct or incorrect, there are practical considerations that may help you decide which one will better suit your purpose.
The first consideration is a simple, internal one: "Will it be more useful, given your research question or your collection, to create a group under _leaning figure_  or under _old man_? Remember that creating groups of related images is the fundamental purpose of classification...
The second consideration is an external one: "What have others done?" To help you with that question, we are now _illustrating_ Iconclass. The sample images will not offer a _ready-made_ answer, but they may point you in a direction. We always advise you to explore the databases from which they were selected, as it will help you get a feeling for the broader context that the images in your collection will join.
A final consideration may also play its part: you don't _have to choose_. Other than the fact that it is more time consuming, there is no real reason why you should not tag an image with "synonymic" notations, if that enriches the information you provide to your users.

Here are two small sets of pictures to illustrate the principle:

          {{% aimg 31a232 %}} 
       
This first set gives priority to __31A232 leaning figure__ and shows several variations of this posture. To express [connotations of the posture](/en/31A232(+9)) keys from the __(+9)__ section could be added.

          {{% aimg 31d16_5 %}} 

The second set gives priority to  __31D16 · old man__ and with the __(+5)__ keys the different postures - sitting, crouching, kneeling, leaning, lying down - could be addressed.

On the [Rijksmuseum website](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/RP-P-OB-245){:target="_read"} a different angle was chosen for the description of the Rembrandt etching. Its English caption reads "Beggar in a high cap, standing and leaning on a stick". Although it is an interesting question whether we first "see" a poorly dressed old man and only afterwards "interpret" this as a beggar, the reason to refer to this caption is much more practical. A search for __beggar__ offers an opportunity to show the use of a Boolean condition when doing a search in Iconclass.
The screenshot below shows the result of a straightforward search for __beggar__: 260 hits with a large number of references to saints.

          {{% aimg beggar001 %}} 

To exclude references to __saints__ from the search result, simply use the word __NOT__ (in capitals) as a token for a Boolean condition. What remains is just a short list which you can scan very quickly.

          {{% aimg beggar002 %}} 

Using multiple words in a search can be an efficient way to filter the results. Usually you can pick up some hints for words to include or exclude by scrolling the list of search results.
Another way to filter the list is by using Iconclass notations. In this particular case __beggar NOT 11H__ would lead to the same result. This will obviously come more easily when you are more familiar with the Iconclass schedules, but paying attention to the notations in the search results will quickly get you there. For your convenience we have gathered the 450 main categories in a separate [__Outline of the Iconclass system__](outline){:target="_read"}.

The illustrations themselves may also give you ideas for searches. A picture like this one by Jacques Callot of _Die Bettler Zunft_ (_the guild of beggars_) could inspire you to formulate another search with a Boolean condition.

          {{% aimg beggarcallot %}} 
          
As you become more aware of the concepts Iconclass puts at your disposal, you will appreciate the possibility of a search like this where the __AND__ condition between _walking_ and _stick_ is implied, and a different type of support - _crutches_ - is also retrieved by adding a Boolean __OR__ condition.
          
          {{% aimg booleanor %}} 

#### Animal world - _A spider_

{{% aimg search003 %}} 

Word searches, even those that will retrieve straightforward tags for simple subject matter, can still benefit from contextual words or associative sidesteps. __Spider__, for this small gouache by Jan Augustin van der Goes, will retrieve 39 results, most of which are linked to __saint Norbert__ who has a chalice with a spider as an attribute: 

          {{% aimg spider001 %}}

But if you add __animal__ you will limit the results to a handful (N.B.: Boolean __AND__ is implied when you search with multiple terms):

          {{% aimg spider002 %}}

Although this small picture of a spider by Van der Goes does not show it, a spider still can make you think about a web. Should you follow this associative link and search for __spider__ and __web__, the search initially produces __0 results__:

          {{% aimg spider003 %}}
          
but when you click the button to __Include keys (+)__ this changes. The search will then also query the secondary "auxiliary" hierarchies of the keys. In this case it produces a small but very relevant set of concepts.

          {{% aimg spider004 %}}

#### Biblical theme - _Christ healing lepers_
     
Often research in iconography follows a meandering pattern of going back and forth between your queries and new directions suggested by the images you retrieve with your searches. The Iconclass browser aims to support this meandering pattern to a certain extent, allowing you to follow hunches and side paths, which could help you to discover information that is new and useful to you. A journey can start with a very simple search, for example to find the concept with which to classify this mosaic scene at Monreale cathedral.

{{% aimg search004 %}} 

Even if you are not very familiar with biblical iconography you will recognize this scene as one where Christ is addressing or blessing a group of men. They are dressed in loincloths and covered by spots on their torso and legs. Some are stretching their hands towards Christ. We can identify them as the __ten lepers__ who are healed by Christ, according to Luke 17:11-19, but it is not easy to determine whether this identification _precedes_ or _follows_ the realization that the spots on their bodies are signs of their leprosy and that the group consists of exactly _ten_ men. As is so often the case, our awareness of the _meaning_ of an iconographic detail actually _leads_ our eyes, blurring the chronology of our iconographic interpretations. Fortunately, we are not dealing here with the psychology of vision or the theory of iconographic analysis, but with the simpler task of finding a fitting Iconclass concept for this scene.

          {{% aimg 73c452 %}}

The most efficient way to find the concept we need would be to combine __Christ__  with the number of the unfortunate group of lepers, __ten__.

          {{% aimg tenlepers %}}
          
That is also the query for which you would need to be well-versed in biblical iconography. If you would not know this particular chapter of Luke's gospel, it is not very likely you would grasp the relevance of the exact number of the group of lepers.
The spots on their bodies, on the other hand, are a clear indication of their illness, so __Christ__ and __lepers__ would be a more obvious combination for a search. You don't have to be a very experienced Iconclass user to know that __73__ is the root notation for all __New Testament__ scenes, so adding that to the search conditions is a concise way to limit the harvest to a short list of concepts.
 
          {{% aimg tenlepers2 %}}
          
When you click on the concept that seems to offer the best fit for the mosaic in Monreale, various elements of the _Illustrated Iconclass_ fall into place. The broader terms in the _path_ through the hierarchy invite you to check out other scenes of __73C45 Christ healing lepers__ or even of __73C4 miracles of Christ ~ healing the sick__ in general.
          
          {{% aimg tenlepers3 %}}

The sample images provide material for comparison. They may help to confirm the identification, offer a slightly different visualization or interpretation, but also raise completely new questions.
This detail from an English psalter, for example, which is a few decades younger than the Palermo mosaic, uses a very similar composition for the same narrative, but there are some variations. The _ten_ men are fully dressed, for example, and the quote from Luke's gospel - _go and show yourselves to the priests_ - in Monreale written on the wall above the head of Christ, is here moved to the banderole he is holding in his hand.
          
          {{% aimg tenlepers4 %}}

When we browse our illustrations of Christ healing lepers we are probably more conscious of the fact that we are looking at the "_iconography of contagion_" than we would have been two years ago. The Covid-pandemic and the - sometimes fiercely debated - "_mouth mask_" policy will make the iconographer much more alert to certain details. For instance, it would now be difficult to overlook the fact that the lepers in various series of bible illustrations dating from the first half of the 16th century, are all wearing some form of face cover, with the exception of the one who is cured and kneels to thank Christ in the illustration on the left ...

          {{% aimg tenlepers5 %}}
                     
#### Portraits - _Family group_

{{% aimg newsearches1 %}}

Iconclass covers a wide spectrum of themes, some of which are among the most common subjects found in image collections. Portraits are undoubtedly among those. Here is a portrait, made in 1832 by François-Joseph Navez, of the Belgian magistrate and politician Théodore Joseph Jonet and his daughters Juliette and Emilie, which was acquired some years ago by the Groeningemuseum in Bruges. Iconographically indexing such a family portrait can be approached from various directions. It is a portrait of historical persons we know by name. It is also a representation of family relations, i.e. of a widowed father and his two daughters, one of whom is engaged to be married. It is also a testimony of social status, of the _haute bourgeoisie_ to which the Jonet family belonged.
Again, whether we provide information about one or all of these aspects or perhaps add other specific details, for example about their fashion choices, does not _depend_ on Iconclass, but it _can_ be influenced by the organization of the schedules and by the _keywords_ that were selected to guide us to concepts. It is therefore a good idea to be flexible when searching for terms.
The richest harvest of concepts is found with a simple search for __portrait__ and with the __keys__-button switched to _include_. Obviously you don't want to scroll through a list of 26,481 results, and the concept that the algorithm sees as 'most relevant' -  _self-portrait of an artist in late Gothic style_ - does not make much sense.

          {{% aimg portrait %}}
          
So adding a second keyword, and excluding the keys is the logical thing to do. As this is a __family group__ you could combine __portrait__ and __family__ but as you can see that does not produce suitable candidates.

          {{% aimg portraitfamily %}}

__Portrait__ and __group__, however, looks much more promising. The results also invite us to take a closer look at three other elements of the Iconclass toolbox, __[bracketed texts](basics#brackets){:target="_read"}__, __[structural digits](basics#struct){:target="_read"}__ and __[letter duplication](basics#double){:target="_read"}__.

          {{% aimg portraitgroup %}}


The results that the algorithm considers _most relevant_, offer two alternative options: portraits of historical persons who remain _anonymous_ because we cannot identify them by name, and portraits of those we _can_ identify. If we know a name, as in our example, we can enter it between __the brackets (...)__ and make it part of the code.
Moreover, the concepts allow us to distinguish between men and women. The male variant is not made explicit but that a single - __B__ - in the notation signifies that the sitter is a man is implied by the fact that the double letter - __BB__ - signifies that the sitter is a woman.
This then would be a suitable notation for the father in this family group as the broader terms in the path demonstrate:

          {{% aimg 61b2withname13 %}}

Complying with the examples originally given in the printed volumes of Iconclass, the name would be entered thus: __61B2(JONET, Théodore Joseph)13__. This default model does not necessarily fit historical names for every period or region, so some variety between projects and databases can be observed.
Obviously, if you would index this portrait with just this one concept, your end users would not be able to retrieve it with a query for _female sitters_ or for the two daughters by their proper names. Should you want to make that possible, you would have to add __61BB2(JONET, Juliette)13__ and __61BB2(JONET, Emilie)13__.
The __-13__ part of the notation (following the brackets) is the __structural digit__, a feature of the Iconclass system with which you can identify recurring, or "structural", patterns of iconography. Using it should make it possible for a search algorithm to  retrieve this pattern - __61B2(...)13__ - and filter a database for all portraits of groups. 

In this particular case it turns out that being quite explicit about the composition of the group - playing around with keywords, asking for __father daughter family group__ - would yield this very precise result:

          {{% aimg fatherfamily %}}

It is important to realize that _retrieving a concept_ from the Iconclass system with the help of such a combination of keywords, implies that the same search could _retrieve any metadata record_ from a database that contains this notation, and - by implication - all relevant images linked to those records. 
Moreover, due to the hierarchical organization of the notation, it will insert the image in the broader context of __family groups__: 

          {{% aimg familygroup %}}

Classifying the portrait with the concept __42B7412 father and daughter(s) (family group)__ would thus mean that one of its close thematic "neighbours" would be Dorothea Lange's famous photograph of [Florence Owens Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Owens_Thompson) (the _Migrant Mother_) with three of her children. This picture would be classified as __42B742 mother and child(ren), woman and child(ren) (family group)__, and they would then share the same _broader term_ for a family group consisting of parents and children:

          {{% aimg family %}}

The social and economical position of the two families could be expressed using the concepts __46A131 bourgeoisie, middle class, citizens, burghers__ and __46A15 the poor__, which would contextualize the images in yet another way. Instead of zooming out we could also zoom in - literally - on the images. It is documented that in the case of Thompson the photographer instructed the two children to turn their faces away from the camera so the mother's face would draw all the attention. Zooming in on the portrait by Navez, we notice the engagement ring on the hand of Juliette which suggests they sat for Navez before her marriage with Joseph-Émile Lequime on July 5th 1832. __Marriage__ as a secondary context for this painting would be made retrievable by the Iconclass concept __42D1712 wedding ring__...

          {{% aimg ring %}}

As explained at the start of this explanation, whatever type of information you want to convey and whatever aspect you want to focus on, depends on decisions that _precede_ the selection of classification concepts to be assigned to the images. The _consequences_ of your selection for their _retrieval and contextualization_, however, are another matter. They should become clearer as you search and browse the system.


### City-views and landscapes - _View of Delft_
Another theme that takes its place among the most common subjects of pictures produced since the 16th century is that of landscapes and city-views, both as their main theme and as the backdrop of a story or a message. One of the most famous city-views is this _View of Delft_ painted around 1660-1661 by Johannes Vermeer.

{{% aimg newsearches2 %}}

A basic concept to tag this painting would be __25I12 prospect of city, town panorama, silhouette of city__. If you are using Iconclass on a regular basis to index a collection of paintings or prints, you will probably know this notation by heart. An institution like the [Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has used it for almost 3,500 objects](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/zoeken?p=1&ps=12&f.classification.iconClassDescription.sort=prospect+of+city%2c+town+panorama%2c+silhouette+of+city&st=Objects){:target="_read"}, so their cataloguers will not need to locate the concept with a keyword search. 

           Remarkably, the Rijksmuseum prefers not to use the actual simple classification code - 25I12 - for 
           searches or display in its URL's, but opts for the complete set of words of the concept definition: 
           https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/zoeken?p=1&ps=12&f.classification.iconClassDescription.sort=prospect+of+city%2c+town+panorama%2c+silhouette+of+city&st=Objects

For those who are less familiar with the system, or want to find additional concepts for details to identify by name, it will be useful to experiment a bit with the keywords, as we shall see.

Among the fairly obvious words you could use, are __city__ and __view__. If you do, the algorithm that determines the ordering of the search results may surprise you a little, as the list will be topped by __25II111 city founders - II - ideal city__.

          {{% aimg cityview %}}
          
The reason for this is basic statistics. The concept definition is just _four_ words long while _two_ of those words are __city__, so _city_ becomes very "relevant" according to the indexing algorithm.
When the results are sorted by notation, they are probably more in line with your expectations: 

          {{% aimg cityview2 %}}

Surprises like this cannot be avoided for the simple reason that algorithms, however smart, are intended to create some order in sets that are simply too large to be processed within an acceptable timeframe. That is the main reason you do well to try a few variations of the keyword searches. __City__ and __panorama__, for example, produce this:

          {{% aimg citypanorama %}}
          
The application of this concept to collections with very heterogeneous content may of course cause widely divergent images to be retrieved with the same database query. A panoramic photograph of New York may be thematically comparable to the _View of Delft_ but the city in the background of the emblem is also represented as a panorama. Both could be tagged with __25I12__...

          {{% aimg panorama2 %}}

The view of an identifiable city will, by definition, contain buildings or other details that you may want to document as named entities. If you would not recognize certain buildings, you wouldn't know which city was represented.
A famous painting like Vermeer's has been extensively analysed; buildings have been identified, Vermeer's exact vantage point has been reconstructed and attempts have even been made to determine the exact date and time - as if the painting were a digital snapshot with a timestamp and geolocation information.

          {{% aimg delft %}}

However that may be, buildings like the __Schiedamse Poort__ and the __Rotterdamse Poort__ or the __Nieuwe Kerk__ are typically among the landmarks that would be tagged as identified details in the metadata.
Of the __Rotterdamse Poort__, for example, you may want to register the fact that it was one of Delft's __city-gates__:

          {{% aimg citygate %}}
          
To find the appropriate notation to enter the specific name of an historical building, simply search for __historical__ and __building__:

          {{% aimg histobuilding %}}

Should both be tagged a little systematically, Vermeer's _View of Delft_ would pop up side by side with this drawing by Balthazar Jooss which shows Delft from more or less the same vantage point ten years before the city-view changed dramatically as both city-gates were torn down in 1836.

          {{% aimg rotterdamsepoort %}}
          
These would be among the Iconclass concepts the descriptions would share:

          11Q712 · church (exterior)
          25I12 · prospect of city, town panorama, silhouette of city
          25I1461 · city-gate
          46C231 · tow-boat, towing-barge
          61E(DELFT) · names of cities and villages (with NAME)
          61F(NIEUWE KERK) · names of historical buildings, sites, streets, etc. (with NAME)
          61F(ROTTERDAMSE POORT) · names of historical buildings, sites, streets, etc. (with NAME)
          
### Recreation - _Couple under an umbrella_

{{% aimg newsearches3 %}}

A keyword that will quickly find us a concept for Ron Mueck's hyperrealistic and larger-than-life sculpture _Couple under an umbrella_ is __beach__. 


          {{% aimg sunbathing %}}
          
Paradoxically, this elderly couple is sitting and lying on the wooden floor of _Museum Voorlinden_ in Wassenaar (NL), so the beach setting is suggested, not visualized. Still, we can safely assume that __43B52 sunbathing (on the beach)__ will be seen by most users as a relevant concept.

          {{% aimg sunbathing2 %}}

If you click on this search result and then open the __Browse__ tab, you will see more of the context confirming that this is indeed an appropriate choice. The search result __43B52 sunbathing (on the beach)__ itself will be shown on the right hand side together with its broader terms; it will also automatically be selected in the concept tree under the __Browse__ tab, where it is marked by a red line. We shall discuss the __Browse__ options later; for now it is enough to realize that you can juxtapose two concepts and thus inspect more of the context.

          {{% aimg 43B52 %}}

The postures of the couple, the parasol over their head, their bathing suits, their interaction, and various other aspects of the image can all be tagged with Iconclass concepts. Here is a set of concepts that could be used. Please remember: first you decide which aspects to record, and only then you select concepts that best match those aspects:

          31AA2351 · sitting on the ground - AA - female human figure
          31A2361 · lying on the back with uplifted upper part of the body
          31B6212(+91) · looking downwards (+ relations with friendly, non-aggressive character
                         (expressive connotations))
          33C23 · couple of lovers
          41D2632 · parasol, sunshade
          42D3 · marriage, married couple, 'matrimonium'
          56F22 · Reciprocal Love
          
It will be clear that some of these concepts suggest that we _know_ more about these "sitters" than we can actually _see_. We cannot see - literally - that they are a _married couple_, or feel _love_ for each other. We would need additional information to establish that these are "correct" labels. In this case, we could ask the artist for confirmation that the quiet display of affection we observe, is "historically" correct.
Although the intention of the artist and the reception thereof by an audience are important, the operative word when we classify aspects of the work is "useful". Even if we are not sure whether we are dealing with a portrait of an actual man and woman, let alone that we are sure about their marital status, applying __42D3 married couple__ and __56F22 Reciprocal Love__ to the image will still make sense. It will ensure that the image appears when the database is searched for the concept of "_married couple_" or the abstract idea of _Love_. If you think that is informative, then applying the code is justified.

### Abstract ideas - concrete forms

Most commentators of Mueck's sculpture are in agreement: the elderly couple convey a message of mutual affection. We've included the Iconclass concept __56F22 Reciprocal Love__ among our suggestions to record this abstract meaning, even though  Mueck's sculpture uses an extremely concrete form to convey this abstract idea. This combination - a concrete form expressing an abstract meaning - is more common than is often realized. And while the abstract ideas gathered in [Iconclass category 5](outline#iconclass5){:target="_read"} are often seen as reserved for symbolic images, like allegories and personifications, emblems and devices, they can actually be used for the interpretation of a wide spectrum of images. Take for instance __56F23 Friendship; 'Amicitia' (Ripa)__ which is a "sibling" of __56F22 Reciprocal Love__ as shown by the consecutive notations.

          {{% aimg 56F23IC %}}
          
The reference to Cesare Ripa's Iconologia that is often included in concept definitions like this one may strengthen the impression that they are intended for specialized use, but the abstract idea of __Friendship__ can of course also be expressed by a straightforward image like this portrait of two young men by Pontormo. One of the men in the portrait is actually pointing at a manuscript quote from Cicero's _De Amicitia_ as a testimony of their friendship.

          {{% aimg 56F23 %}}


Here are three examples of concrete actions visualizing the abstract notion of __Impossibility__ all dating from the 1540's. Hans Sebald Beham shows a man trying to uproot a tree, Alciato's emblem uses the _washing of an Ethiopian_ and the Horapollo picture shows a man walking without a head and feet walking on water.
