## Using the Illustrated Iconclass: Browse & Search  

Those who have been using Iconclass for some time and those who are new to it, will come to this new, illustrated edition with different expectations and different ideas about what it is for and how it works. This explanation therefore aims to take into account two differen user groups.

Initially, of course, this overview of the __Search__ and __Browse__ functionality will make more sense if you have some experience with Iconclass. If that is your case, you still may need a little time to adjust to the changes, as with all new versions of software that you are familiar with. Do remember, however, that you have a direct line to the makers of this Iconclass browser system. You will find the __Feedback__ button at the top right hand corner of the browser window. If you have comments or questions, make sure to use it. Your experiences are very valuable to us. If you are new to Iconclass, your experiences are of course no less valuable, as you will look at its functionalities with fresh eyes. The invitation to use the Feedback button is there for you too.

### But first...: register, to see the illustrations
To take full advantage of this _Illustrated edition of Iconclass_ you should __register__. It is simple and it is free and it will enable us to respond to you if you have comments or questions and use the Feedback button.

If you have registered and are logged in, you will see your user name (email address) appear in the top right hand corner,

{{% aimg register2 %}}

but, more importantly, you will see the illustrations that we have added to the browser for comparison and inspiration. The illustrations shown for a particular concept are selected when an __exactly matching notation__ is found in the partner databases as a tag for pictures. Our example - __23A allegory of Time and Eternity__ - has been used to tag 31 images. By default all images are shown in the _Illustrated Iconclass_, except when there is a very rich harvest for a particular concept. In that case a random selection is shown.

### Search
Assigning Iconclass concepts to an image is always a secondary step in the creation of subject information. The primary steps in the process are identifying what is in front of your eyes and deciding what information you actually want to convey about it. That will depend on a broad spectrum of parameters - from the purpose and the budget of your project to the depth of your iconographic expertise - and the examples we are using here can only cover a tiny part of that spectrum. Moreover, in actual cataloguing practice your criteria for the selection of details will inevitably evolve over time, because you will learn from your observations and simply "see" more as you go along.

##### Old man leaning on a staff

To find concepts to tag this etching by Rembrandt - __a poorly dressed old man leaning on a staff__ - a point of departure could be to search with the words __old__ and __man__. The results of a search are presented in a scrollable list, sorted by relevance or by [notation](basics#notations){:target="_read"}.
Sorted by __relevance__, these are the first search results: 

          {{% aimg search_oldman %}} 

The next step would be to check the context of a candidate concept, i.e. to see its place in the hierarchy and its 'siblings' which may also suit your purpose. To do so, just click on it, as is illustrated below for __31D16 old man__.

          {{% aimg 31d16 %}}

The concept you click on is then shown on the right in a larger font with the notation in red. The concept's _broader terms_ - its "__path__" through the hierarchy - are listed above the selected one, right up to the main category, in this case __3 Human Being, Man in General__. To widen the search, just click on one of the broader terms in the path.

Below the _related keywords_, the three narrower terms or "__children__" of __31D16 old man__ are presented. They can be selected with a click if you need a more specific concept.
In addition, the list of available __[keys](basics#keys){:target="_read"}__, is shown, allowing you to add even more detail to  __31D16 old man__.
One of the keys is: __31D16(+5) 路 old man (+ positions (of the human figure))__. Among its further subdivisions we find: __31D16(+52) 路 old man (+ leaning)__, which would be an appropriate tag for our image.


#### Is there a "correct" notation?
If we had started our search not with "__old__" and "__man__" but with "__leaning__", the result would of course have been different:

          {{% aimg 31a232_8 %}} 

The concept __31A232 leaning figure__ itself can also be made more specific with another key, as highlighted in the screenshot above. This makes it possible to create an alternative tag for the same subject:
__31A232(+813) 路 leaning figure (+ old male (human being))__.
"Synonyms" like this raise the question whether one of the options is the "__correct__" one. And while neither of the alternatives is intrinsically correct or incorrect, there are practical considerations that may help you decide which one will better suit your purpose.
The first consideration is a simple, internal one: "Will it be more useful, given your research question or your collection, to create a group under _leaning figure_  or under _old man_? Remember that creating groups of related images is the fundamental purpose of classification...
The second consideration is an external one: "What have others done?" To help you with that question, we are now _illustrating_ Iconclass. The sample images will not offer a _ready-made_ answer, but they may point you in a direction. We always advise you to explore the databases from which they were selected, as it will help you get a feeling for the broader context that the images in your collection will join.
A final consideration may also play its part: you don't _have to choose_. Other than the fact that it is more time consuming, there is no real reason why you should not tag an image with "synonymic" notations, if that enriches the information you provide to your users.

Here are two small sets of pictures to illustrate the principle:

          {{% aimg 31a232 %}} 
       
This first set gives priority to __31A232 leaning figure__ and shows several variations of this posture. To express [connotations of the posture](/en/31A232(+9)) keys from the __(+9)__ section could be added.

          {{% aimg 31d16_5 %}} 

The second set gives priority to  __31D16 路 old man__ and with the __(+5)__ keys the different postures - sitting, crouching, kneeling, leaning, lying down - could be addressed.

On the [Rijksmuseum website](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/collectie/RP-P-OB-245){:target="_read"} a different angle was chosen for the description of the Rembrandt etching. Its English caption reads "Beggar in a high cap, standing and leaning on a stick". Although it is an interesting question whether we first "see" a poorly dressed old man and only afterwards "interpret" this as a beggar, the reason to refer to this caption is much more practical. A search for __beggar__ offers an opportunity to show the use of a Boolean condition when doing a search in Iconclass.
The screenshot below shows the result of a straightforward search for __beggar__: 260 hits with a large number of references to saints.

          {{% aimg beggar001 %}} 

To exclude references to __saints__ from the search result, simply use the word __NOT__ (in capitals) as a token for a Boolean condition. What remains is just a short list which you can scan very quickly.

          {{% aimg beggar002 %}} 

Using multiple words in a search can be an efficient way to filter the results. Usually you can pick up some hints for words to include or exclude by scrolling the list of search results.
Another way to filter the list is by using Iconclass notations. In this particular case __beggar NOT 11H__ would lead to the same result. This will obviously come more easily when you are more familiar with the Iconclass schedules, but paying attention to the notations in the search results will quickly get you there. For your convenience we have gathered the 450 main categories in a separate [__Outline of the Iconclass system__](outline){:target="_read"}.

The illustrations themselves may also give you ideas for searches. A picture like this one by Jacques Callot of _Die Bettler Zunft_ (_the guild of beggars_) could inspire you to formulate another search with a Boolean condition.

          {{% aimg beggarcallot %}} 
          
As you become more aware of the concepts Iconclass puts at your disposal, you will appreciate the possibility of a search like this where the __AND__ condition between _walking_ and _stick_ is implied, and a different type of support - _crutches_ - is also retrieved by adding a Boolean __OR__ condition.
          
          {{% aimg booleanor %}} 

#### A spider

{{% aimg search003 %}} 

Word searches, even those that will retrieve straightforward tags for simple subject matter, can still benefit from contextual words or associative sidesteps. __Spider__, for this small gouache by Jan Augustin van der Goes, will retrieve 39 results, most of which are linked to __saint Norbert__ who has a chalice with a spider as an attribute: 

          {{% aimg spider001 %}}

But if you add __animal__ you will limit the results to a handful (N.B.: Boolean __AND__ is implied when you search with multiple terms):

          {{% aimg spider002 %}}

Although this small picture of a spider by Van der Goes does not show it, a spider still can make you think about a web. Should you follow this associative link and search for __spider__ and __web__, the search initially produces __0 results__:

          {{% aimg spider003 %}}
          
but when you click the button to __Include keys (+)__ this changes. The search will then also query the secondary "auxiliary" hierarchies of the keys. In this case it produces a small but very relevant set of concepts.

          {{% aimg spider004 %}}

#### Christ healing lepers
     
Often research in iconography follows a meandering pattern of going back and forth between your queries and new directions suggested by the images you retrieve with your searches. The Iconclass browser aims to support this meandering pattern to a certain extent, allowing you to follow hunches and side paths, which could help you to discover information that is new and useful to you. A journey can start with a very simple search, for example to find the concept with which to classify this mosaic scene at Monreale cathedral.

{{% aimg search004 %}} 

Even if you are not very familiar with biblical iconography you will recognize this scene as one where Christ is addressing or blessing a group of men. They are dressed in loincloths and covered by spots on their torso and legs. Some are stretching their hands towards Christ. We can identify them as the __ten lepers__ who are healed by Christ, according to Luke 17:11-19, but it is not easy to determine whether this identification _precedes_ or _follows_ the realization that the spots on their bodies are signs of their leprosy and that the group consists of exactly _ten_ men. As is so often the case, our awareness of the _meaning_ of an iconographic detail actually _leads_ our eyes, blurring the chronology of our iconographic interpretations. Fortunately, we are not dealing here with the psychology of vision or the theory of iconographic analysis, but with the simpler task of finding a fitting Iconclass concept for this scene.

          {{% aimg 73c452 %}}

The most efficient way to find the concept we need would be to combine __Christ__  with the number of the unfortunate group of lepers, __ten__.

          {{% aimg tenlepers %}}
          
That is also the query for which you would need to be well-versed in biblical iconography. If you would not know this particular chapter of Luke's gospel, it is not very likely you would grasp the relevance of the exact number of the group of lepers.
The spots on their bodies, on the other hand, are a clear indication of their illness, so __Christ__ and __lepers__ would be a more obvious combination for a search. You don't have to be a very experienced Iconclass user to know that __73__ is the root notation for all __New Testament__ scenes, so adding that to the search conditions is a concise way to limit the harvest to a short list of concepts.
 
          {{% aimg tenlepers2 %}}
          
When you click on the concept that seems to offer the best fit for the mosaic in Monreale, various elements of the _Illustrated Iconclass_ fall into place. The broader terms in the _path_ through the hierarchy invite you to check out other scenes of __73C45 Christ healing lepers__ or even of __73C4 miracles of Christ ~ healing the sick__ in general. The sample images provide material for comparison.
          
          {{% aimg tenlepers3 %}}

They may help to confirm the identification, offer a slightly different visualization or interpretation, but also raise completely new questions.
This detail from an English psalter, for example, which is a few decades younger than the Palermo mosaic, uses a very similar composition, but the inscription, in Monreale placed on the wall above the head of Christ, is here moved to the scroll he is holding in his hand.
          
          {{% aimg tenlepers4 %}}

When we browse the illustrations we have of Christ healing lepers we are probably more conscious of the fact that we are looking at the "_iconography of contagion_" than we would have been two years ago. The Covid-pandemic and the - sometimes fiercely debated - "_mouth mask_" policy has made it difficult to overlook the fact that the lepers in various series of illustrations of this Gospel chapter, dating from the first half of the 16th century, are all wearing some form of face cover.

### Browse

Browsing the tree of concepts is a straightforward process: clicking on a concept causes it to "open" and to show its hierarchical "children". A red line marks 


### Sample searches

Only show items from notation 5, the bible:

`5`

If you want to _exclude_ something, this could be handy:

`((?<!11D).)*$` and this will filter out all notations that start with "11D"
