### E. Web-based systems with rich iconographic information, _not_ using Iconclass

In Henri van de Waal's personal archive there was a folder named "_Other systems_". There he collected information about systems with purposes similar to what he envisaged for Iconclass. Not all of them were systems for the subject access to images.
In a sense this is our page of "_other systems_". It contains references to websites with subject information about image collections that make use of other vocabularies than Iconclass, or _do_ contain Iconclass internally, but do not offer this information to their end users.
Needless to say this is a very open-ended collection, and we are very grateful for additional information to expand this survey.

The collections include images and descriptive data related to the iconography of works of art produced between late Antiquity and the sixteenth century. Although the Index of Medieval Art was formerly known as the Index of Christian Art, it now includes secular subjects as well as a growing number of subjects from medieval Jewish and Islamic culture.<br/>

<tr><td valign="top">{{% aimg aboutpage_warburg %}}<br/></td><td valign="top"><b>The Warburg Institute Iconographic Database</b>, online since 2010. It is an open-access collection of digital images organised according to an iconographic taxonomy similar to the iconographic classification system that Rudolf Wittkower developed for the analogue Photographic Collection in the 1930s. The database contains ca 100,000 images at present -- mainly digitised photos from the Photographic Collection, but also new images from a variety of sources, and even images that are held on external websites, but complement the Warburg's holdings.<br/>

<tr><td valign="top">{{% aimg aboutpage_loctgm %}}<br/></td><td valign="top">The <b>Thesaurus for Graphic Materials</b> is a tool for indexing visual materials by subject and by genre/format. The thesaurus includes more than 7,000 subject terms and 650 genre/format terms to index types of photographs, prints, design drawings, ephemera, and other pictures. In 2007, the subject and genre/format vocabularies, previously maintained separately, were merged into a single list and migrated to new software, MultiTes.
Other minor changes are clarified in the links below. For questions about the thesaurus, contact TGM editors at: tgmed@loc.gov.<br/>
