#### About the team

__Producers__
The online Iconclass browser system has been produced and maintained by Etienne Posthumus and Hans Brandhorst since 2005. All programming has been taken care of by Etienne, while Hans has been responsible for content and editing. Together they have developed the functionalities that are at your disposal.

__Active community__
However, this _illustrated edition_ would not have been possible without the work of all the cataloguers who have been enriching millions of images with structured iconographic information, samples of which are offered here to help you on your way.
Strictly speaking they are not part of the "team", but they do form the community of users, who are putting Henri van de Waal's theories into practice.

__Become a team member__
The Iconclass Browser software is Open Source and the Iconclass data files are Open Data. Both are deposited in a Github repository, so anyone who wants to contribute and help improve the browser system or the content of the vocabulary can do so.
We welcome all contributions from the community of users. 

We can be contacted via [this form](https://forms.gle/twPq7swQZXmSX46G8), or if you prefer, you can send and email to info@iconclass.org
